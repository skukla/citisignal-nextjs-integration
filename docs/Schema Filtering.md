**Yes, Adobe's API Mesh has powerful features specifically designed to help filter GraphQL schemas and reduce noise**, which directly addresses your Postman challenge. API Mesh includes the **`filterSchema` transform** that provides precise control over what appears in your GraphQL schema.

## How Adobe API Mesh's `filterSchema` Transform Works

The `filterSchema` transform allows you to **include or exclude specific schema elements** from your mesh, including:[1]

- **Entire types** (e.g., remove `Customer`, `Cart` types)
- **Specific queries and mutations** (e.g., exclude deprecated operations)  
- **Individual fields** from types
- **Arguments** from fields

### Filter Syntax Examples

The transform uses an intuitive syntax with exclamation marks (`!`) for exclusions and curly braces (`{}`) for grouping:[1]

```json
{
  "transforms": [
    {
      "filterSchema": {
        "filters": [
          "Query.!customer",                              // Remove customer query
          "Query.!{category, customerOrders}",            // Remove multiple queries
          "Mutation.!{createCustomer, createEmptyCart}",  // Remove mutations
          "Type.!{Customer, Cart}",                       // Remove entire types
          "Customer.{firstname, lastname, email}",        // Keep only specific fields
          "Query.products.!{pageSize, currentPage}"       // Remove specific arguments
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits for Your Postman Use Case

### 1. **Clean Schema Views**
API Mesh creates a filtered, unified GraphQL endpoint that you can connect to Postman. Instead of seeing hundreds of operations, you'll only see what you've explicitly allowed.

### 2. **Multiple Filtering Approaches**
- **Exclusion-based**: Remove specific unwanted elements
- **Inclusion-based**: Specify only what you want to keep
- **Wildcard filtering**: Use `Query.*` patterns to apply rules broadly[1]

### 3. **Conflicts Resolution**
API Mesh can handle schema conflicts between multiple sources using transforms like `prefix` to namespace operations, preventing naming collisions.[2]

## Implementation Strategy

**Step 1: Set up API Mesh Configuration**
```json
{
  "meshConfig": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "YourGraphQLAPI",
        "handler": {
          "graphql": {
            "endpoint": "https://your-api.com/graphql"
          }
        },
        "transforms": [
          {
            "filterSchema": {
              "filters": [
                // Define your filtering rules here
                "Query.!deprecatedQuery",
                "Mutation.!{oldMutation, testMutation}",
                "Type.!InternalType"
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Deploy and Connect to Postman**
After deploying your mesh, you get a clean GraphQL endpoint that you can use in Postman with only the operations you want visible.[3]

**Step 3: Advanced Filtering**
You can combine multiple transforms for sophisticated filtering:
- **`filterSchema`**: Remove unwanted elements
- **`prefix`**: Add namespacing to avoid conflicts  
- **`rename`**: Change operation names for clarity[4]

## Additional Advantages

- **Performance**: Filtered schemas reduce payload size and improve query performance[5]
- **Security**: Hide internal/admin operations from client-facing schemas[6]
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner schemas are easier to work with and document[7]
- **Integration**: Combine multiple GraphQL sources into a single, filtered endpoint[8]

Adobe API Mesh essentially solves your Postman "noise" problem by creating a curated, filtered GraphQL schema that contains only the operations and types you actually need, making it much more manageable for development and testing.
