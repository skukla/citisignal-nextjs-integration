# Adobe API Mesh Additional Resolvers: Limitations and Constraints

Yes, Adobe API Mesh has several significant limitations in its additional resolvers that can prevent the use of helper functions from external files, particularly in the edge mesh environment. Here are the key constraints:

## File System and Module Loading Limitations

**Restricted File Access**: Adobe API Mesh additional resolvers operate in a sandboxed environment with strict limitations on file system access. When deploying resolvers:[1]

- Only **JavaScript (.js)** and **JSON (.json)** files are supported in the files array[1]
- Referenced files must be in the **same directory** as the mesh configuration file[1]
- File paths are limited to **less than 25 characters**[1]
- Files cannot be located in the **home (~) directory**[1]

## Module System Constraints

**CommonJS Module Limitations**: Adobe API Mesh resolvers use a CommonJS-style module system with `module.exports` and cannot import external npm packages or ES modules in the traditional way. The resolvers are structured as:[2][3]

```javascript
module.exports = {
  resolvers: {
    // resolver logic here
  }
};
```

**No External Dependencies**: Unlike standard Node.js applications, API Mesh resolvers **cannot use `require()` to import external npm modules** or helper functions from separate files. This is a significant limitation for code organization and reusability.[4]

## Edge Mesh Specific Restrictions

**Enhanced Limitations in Edge Environment**: With the transition to edge meshes, certain features have become unavailable due to **compatibility limitations**. The edge environment operates with:[5]

- Stricter security constraints
- Limited access to Node.js built-in modules
- No support for external module imports
- Reduced file system access

## Alternative Solutions and Workarounds

**Inline Code Requirements**: All helper functions and utilities must be defined **within the same resolver file** rather than imported from external files. For complex logic, developers must:

1. **Embed all helper functions** directly in the additional-resolvers.js file
2. **Use the built-in `fetch()` function** for external API calls instead of importing HTTP libraries[2]
3. **Leverage the `context.logger`** for debugging instead of `console.log` (which is not supported)[6][4]

**Built-in Capabilities**: API Mesh does provide some built-in functionality:
- **`globalThis.fetch()`** for HTTP requests[2]
- **`context.logger`** for logging[6]
- Access to source APIs through the context object[2]

## Practical Implications

These limitations mean that developers cannot:
- Import utility libraries from npm packages
- Share common helper functions across multiple resolver files
- Use advanced Node.js modules for complex operations
- Implement modular code architecture within resolvers

**Recommendation**: When designing API Mesh resolvers, plan for a **self-contained approach** where all necessary logic is included within individual resolver files. For complex scenarios requiring external modules, consider implementing the logic in a separate microservice that API Mesh can call via HTTP requests using the built-in `fetch()` functionality.[2]
